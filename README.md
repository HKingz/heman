This is a C99 library of **he**ight**ma**p utilities that has nothing to do with the Masters of the Universe.

## Setup

```bash
. env.sh
# lots of stuff spews out as it builds the container...
heman-bash
# now you're inside your VM and you can try typing this:
scons test
# you should now see a bunch of PNG files!
```
